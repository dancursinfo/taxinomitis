            This block lets you use machine learning models in your Scratch projects.
            However, when you tried to use it, it didn't work because <strong>you don't seem to have a machine learning model</strong>.

            There are a few reasons why this might have happened:

                    If this is the problem, use the <strong>train new machine learning model</strong> block to train a model.
