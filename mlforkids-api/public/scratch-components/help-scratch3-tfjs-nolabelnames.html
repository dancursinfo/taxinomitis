            The recognise label block lets you use TensorFlow.js models in your Scratch projects. TensorFlow.js models often
            include a file called <code>metadata.json</code> that has extra information about the model
            (such as <a target="_blank" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/tm-model/ZvFOSdrzb/metadata.json">this one</a>).
        </div>
        <div class="help-section">
            The model you are using doesn't seem to have a metadata.json file. That means <strong>the Scratch
            blocks don't know the names of the labels the model has been trained to recognise</strong>.
        </div>
        <div class="help-section">
            That means the <code>recognise (label)</code> block will return values like <code>label 10</code>, referring to
            position of the label in the list of labels the model was trained to recognise. You will need to look up what
            this means in the documentation for the model you are using.
