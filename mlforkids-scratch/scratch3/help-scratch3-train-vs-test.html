            You asked your machine learning model to predict which training bucket some
            text should go in.

            The text you gave to the machine learning model looked like text that you
            used to train the model.

            This is okay. It should work. But it isn't a great test of what your machine
            learning model has learned from your training.

        <div class="help-section">
            If you really want to know whether your machine learning model has learned
            how to make good predictions, you need to test it with text that it has never
            seen before.
